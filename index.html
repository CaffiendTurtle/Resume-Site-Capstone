        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p> I am a recent HTML and CSS focused web developer that comes from a digital design background.<br/>
            My background in graphic design and UI/UX design allows me to put visual assets into<br/>
            perspective with the back-end functionality of web design. My goal is to create a product that<br/>
            exudes personality visually and attracts users to a client's site through smooth and functional<br/>
            online experiences. Design for everyone is my mantra and I pride in all I do is how I work.
